ARToolKitPlus 2.1.1

ARToolKit is a software library that can be used to calculate
camera position and orientation relative to physical markers
in real time. This enables the easy development of a wide range
of Augmented Reality applications.

ARToolKitPlus is an extended version of ARToolKit's vision code
that adds features, but breaks compatibility due to a new
class-based API. ARToolKitPlus does not come with integrated
support for VRML nor does it come with a camera library.
